This file runs the K-Means clustering algorithm on a variety of input images supporting both Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics. To process the input data, images are first condensed and flattened into 2D arrays for processing. Modifying the number of clusters (k) correspondingly changes the number of available pixel colors in each image. Each cluster of pixels will have the same average color. Other functions of the file include assigning clusters, recalculating centroids for each iteration, and checking to see if the algorithm converged. Lastly, three input images are fed to the algorithm at different k assignments.
